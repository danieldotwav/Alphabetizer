# Alphabetizer
This C++ program demonstrates two methods for alphabetizing a string of letters. It provides insights into different sorting techniques and their time complexities.

## **Sorting Techniques:**

1. Built-in Sort (Algorithmic Approach): This method uses the built-in 'sort' function to sort the letters in the input string. It showcases the standard sorting algorithm's time complexity.

2. Hash-based Sort: In this approach, a hash array is employed to count the occurrences of each letter in the input string and then reconstruct the sorted string. This technique has a linear time complexity.

## **Key Features:**

User-friendly input for string of letters.
Comparison of sorting methods and their time complexities.
Handling of uppercase letters in the explanations.
Feel free to explore and compare the sorting techniques used in this program!
